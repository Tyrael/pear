<s>Stefan Esser's php extension for dumping opcode</s>
<d>
Bytekit is a PHP extension that provides a userspace representation of the opcodes generated by the Zend engine compiler built into PHP. This extension provides not only access to the raw op_array data but also contains a Zend engine disassembler that exports control flow information in form of code flow graphs and basic blocks. Bytekit is meant as a tool to understand the internals of PHP better, to debug Zend engine error cases and as base to develop all kinds of static and dynamic code analysis tools.
